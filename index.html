      <h3 style="text-align:center;">I am a Software developer</h3>
      <p>I am currently learning and growing as a fullstack developer learning both front end and back end development. My experience spans over many languages mainly being Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Python. I am knowledgable in C, C++ and C# as well
      but am not as profound in them as I am with the languages mentioned earlier. My experience comes from many personal projects and real world applications that I have worked on using the prior languages and have worked with a team before to develop a real
      world application as well as a website where we had roles assigned to each team member and worked towards a goal with set timeline and planning.</p>

      <p>I like to use my free time either gaming or coding and draw or design some graphics in my free time every once in a while. I love to take on new projects and work on things that keep me going, always thinking of new ideas to create and add to my knowledge.
      I believe doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life which always have me on the lookout for new hobbies that I can adopt and discovering new things. My curiosity is what I believe pushes me to learn new things and improve upon
      myself whenever and wherever I can.</p>

      <div style="color:#ddd;background-color:#282E34;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
      <p>Never giving up until I can find a solution to the challenges that I face is what I believe to be my greatest strength as from my past experiences I tend to face challenges head on rather than looking for a different path when faced with an obstacle. Other than
      that I have a habbit of always planning things ahead of time and breaking the project into small parts by setting milestones and time frames for all my projects, this practice is what I believe has made me punctual and very efficient with deadlines and timelines
      as it helps me manage my time better and give more time to important processes such as testing and planning phase for my projects.</p>
